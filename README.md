Objects-figures of the following types are given: square, triangle, circle, trapezoid. Each shape can be drawn, its area and color can be obtained. Also, shapes have unique methods, for example: return radius, hypotenuse length, side length, etc.
We need to generate a random set of shapes, the number of objects in the set is also unknown in advance.
After generating the array, we need to display the entire list of objects that we have.

For example:
Shape: square, area: 25 sq. units, side length: 5 units, color: blue
Figure: triangle, area: 12.5 square units, hypotenuse: 7.1 units, color: yellow# Objects-figures
